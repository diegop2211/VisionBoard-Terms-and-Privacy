  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective October 07, 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Diego Pineda</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the <strong>VisionBoard</strong> mobile application (the “App”).</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We collect the minimum data needed to operate the App and process in-app purchases.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
    <li>The App does not use third-party advertising or tracking.</li>
    <li>Questions? Contact <a href="mailto:pine5510@vandals.uidaho.edu">pine5510@vandals.uidaho.edu</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on how you use the App and which optional features you enable, we may process the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purchase information</strong> (required for premium unlock): transaction receipts, product IDs, and purchase status provided by Apple; purchase verification via a service such as RevenueCat.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> (to improve stability): crash logs and performance data (e.g., via Sentry or similar).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data (optional)</strong>: basic, aggregate events about which screens/features are used to guide improvements. No ad tracking.</li>
    <li><strong>User content</strong>: images/notes/boards you create. By default these live on your device; if you enable cloud sync/backup (e.g., Firebase or iCloud), your content will be transmitted and stored there under your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Support communications</strong>: any information you send us by email or in-app support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core functionality (including unlocking purchases and restoring on the same Apple ID).</li>
    <li>Maintain and improve the App (e.g., diagnose crashes, measure reliability).</li>
    <li>Communicate about updates, security, and support.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We share information only as needed to run the App or when required by law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Processors/Service providers</strong>: Apple (payments), purchase verification (e.g., RevenueCat), diagnostics (e.g., Sentry), and optional cloud storage/sync (e.g., Firebase/iCloud if enabled).</li>
    <li><strong>Legal and safety</strong>: to comply with law, protect rights, or respond to lawful requests.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell personal information and we do not permit cross-site tracking.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We keep information only as long as needed to provide the App and meet legal obligations. If you enable cloud sync, you may delete your content using your cloud provider’s tools. You may request deletion of support records at any time.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict use of your data. To exercise these rights, email <a href="mailto:pine5510@vandals.uidaho.edu">pine5510@vandals.uidaho.edu</a>.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Information may be processed in countries other than where you live. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy. We will change the “Effective” date and, where required, provide notice in the App.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
