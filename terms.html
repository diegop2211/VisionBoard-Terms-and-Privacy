  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective October 07, 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the <strong>VisionBoard</strong> mobile application (the “App”), provided by <strong>Diego Pineda</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1) Eligibility & License</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App.</li>
    <li>We grant you a limited, personal, non-transferable license to use the App for lawful purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) In-App Purchase & Restore</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Certain features are unlocked via a one-time purchase of <strong>$9.99 (one-time)</strong> processed by Apple. Apple’s terms govern all payments and refunds.</li>
    <li>Use “Restore Purchases” to re-unlock on devices signed into the same Apple ID.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Content & Backups</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for the content you create in the App and for maintaining any backups (device or cloud) you rely on.</li>
    <li>If you enable cloud sync/backup, content will be stored with your chosen provider (e.g., Firebase/iCloud) under their terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Acceptable Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use the App to break the law, infringe others’ rights, or disrupt services.</li>
    <li>Do not reverse engineer or attempt to access the App’s source code except as permitted by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The App and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws.</p>

  <h2>6) Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may integrate third-party services (e.g., purchase verification, diagnostics, or optional cloud storage). Your use of those services is subject to their terms and privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>7) Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

  <h2>8) Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, arising out of or relating to your use of the App.</p>

  <h2>9) Indemnity</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising out of your misuse of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>10) Changes</h2>
  <p>We may modify these Terms. If we make material changes, we will notify you in the App or by other reasonable means. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>11) Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or as required by law. Upon termination, Sections 5–9 and 11–12 survive.</p>

  <h2>12) Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Arizona, USA</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.</p>

  <h2>13) Apple EULA</h2>
  <p>Your use of the App is also subject to Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">Licensed Application End User License Agreement (EULA)</a>. If there is a conflict, Apple’s EULA will control for matters it covers.</p>
